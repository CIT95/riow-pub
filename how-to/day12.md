# Day 12
In your 100days folder create a new folder named day12 and in that folder create a new file named readme.md. Make sure you are writing PEP8 compliant code.

# Video 116
Create a new python file in you folder and name it main.py and code along with Dr. Angela, I don't feel these are regular challenges, once complete commit your code with message "Video 116 Code". Do you understand the scope now? Tell me in your readme.md. 

# Video 117
Code along with this video in the main.py.  

# Video 118
Code along with this video in the main.py and once finished commit the code with "Video 117 and 118 Code".

# Video 119
Code along with this video in the main.py and once finished commit the code with "Video 119 Code".

# Quiz 9:
Report your score in your readme.md

# Video 120 
Create a new file name it final.py and watch the demostration of the guessing game, in your readme.md create that list of task you need to do to create the game outout, then attempt the output on your own and once you finished or feel you want to view the solution commit your code with "My Code Video 120"

# Video 121
Then, either comment out your code or create a new file for the solution code and code along with Dr Angela solution after you finished commit with "Code Video 121" and if you created a new filename report that in your readme.md

Interesting, I actually liked my version of the guessing game better!!!  Do you ever had that experience, when coding the challenges for final project? But I do see how Dr Angela version does a better job at using the concept of scope from this day's work.

In your readme.md, report if you are hard on yourself! 

I know I am sometimes and I've learned that it does not help me get work done!!
