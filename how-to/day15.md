# Day 15

In your 100days folder create a new folder named day15 and in that folder create a new file named readme.md.

# Video 137 thru 141
Since we have setup our local dev enivornment already, you can skip these video(s), but I did watch them and I was able to find all the benefits of PyCharm in VSCODE.  If you have anything you were unable to find in VSCODE let me know. 

# Video 142
Create a new file named main.py and watch the video that goes over the requirements for the project.  Create a todo.md and in that file list the task you need to complete for this project. Then code your attempt at the requirements, make sure you give this work the effort it requires.  Once you feel you want to go thru the solution then commit your code with this message "Video 142 My Code".

# Video 143
Either copy your attempt into a different file  or comment it out and code along with Dr. Angela solution, once you finish then commit this code with message "Video 143 Solution"

# Video 144
What are you thoughts on Dr. Angela study location suggestion?  Tell me in your readme.md and also write something on your thoughts on the coffee machine project. 

I got working code and I felt it was a good challenge!!
