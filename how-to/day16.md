# Day 16

In your 100days folder create a new folder named day16 and in that folder create a new file named readme.md.

# Video 145 and 146
What this video!  Really great explanation of OOP!!

# Video 147
Create a new file named main.py and watch and code along with the video, there is two pretty small challenges here, so do attempt them on your own and once done commit your code with message "Video 147 Code"!  In your readme.md let me know how it was to see the GUI screen show up!  

# Video 148
Check out the video where I go over venv for how to create a virtual enivornment for loading PrettyTable into day16 folder. Link to updated instruction:

Video link - https://youtu.be/D9THY95j0eU

No commit required here.

# Video 149

In the main.py file code along and this video, the challenges are again small, but do attempt them on your own and once done commit with "Video 148 and 149 Code".

# Quiz 10
Take the quiz and report your score in your readme.md file. 

# Video 150
I downloaded the zip file from the Udemy course and unzipped it into a new folder in day16 named coffee_machine.  Watch to understand the challenge and then code your attempt to the coffee machine using OOP code.  Once you have working code or you are ready to move on commit your code with "Video 150 My Code".

# Video 151
Then watch the solution and update your code or create a different file with the solution code.

# Video 152
Great advice!

In in your readme.md let me know how you did on the coffee machine project!!
