# Day 17
In your 100days folder create a new folder named day17 and in that folder create a new file named readme.md.

# Video 153
Watch the intro video

# Video 154
Create a new file in this folder name it main.py, code along with Dr Angela. 

# Video 155
Continue coding along in main.py use the commit message "Video 155 Code"

# Video 156
Continue coding along in main.py use the commit message "Video 156 Code"

# Video 157
Create a new folder inside of day17 and name it quiz and either copy the code from the repl.it or download the zip file and copy the files into this new folder.I did notice that VSCODE as a different class signature!  

In the video Dr Angela gives you a challenge, report back on your readme.md if you got the class setup code correct?  Once done commit message "Video 157 Code"

# Video 158
Watch the video undestand the challenge and then write your own code in the main.py file, once done commit message "Video 157 My Code".  Then watch the solution and update your code if needed. I found I could write this in 1 line, but I think Dr Angela code is more readable then my own.  

# Video 159
Watch the video to understand the challenge, I'll admit it took me a bit to really understand what was happening here, but after using the debugging tools I was able to figure it out.  The key to this one is was that you are  given the current question_number.  Attempt this challenge and commit your code with the message "Video 158 My Code, then watch the solution and update your code if needed.  

# Video 160
Watch the video to understand the challenge, attempt this challenge and commit your code with the message "Video 160 My Code", then watch the solution and update your code if needed.  

# HEADS UP<<<>>>
I know for my code on these next 2 challenges, I kept getting an error on the reference to the text and the answer and running debugging in VSCODE I found that for some reason the enty in the question_bank was a tuple (kinda like a list) and I needed to reference both this way: 

current_question.text[0]
current_question.answer[0]

This way be the way I downloaded the data.py or that file might have changed or something else, just wanted to let you know!

# Video 161
Watch the video to understand the challenge, attempt this challenge and commit your code with the message "Video 161 My Code, then watch the solution and update your code if needed. I realize there are a couple of challenges here.  

# Video 162
Select some new questions from the Trivia Database and attempt this challange, once you are get working commit message " Video 162 My Code", then watch the solution and update your code if needed.  That was fun!!

# Video 163
In your readme.md file do you feel you are running for the bus?
