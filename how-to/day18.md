# Day 18
In your 100days folder create a new folder named day18 and in that folder create a new file named readme.md.

# Video 164
Watch this video

Did you noticed the folder name here is venv....so is Dr. Angela using a virtual enivornment...I would say yes.  

Create a new file named main.py and code along with Dr Angela, no commit needed here. Such an important discussion about reading docs and searching.  

# Video 166
Using the main.py file, watch the video and understand the challenge, then write your code for this challenge, once done commit your code with this message "Challenge 1 My Code". Then watch the solution and update any code you feel is better written then what your code output was. I used the find and replace in VSCODE to rename the variable here!  

# Video 167
Watch and take a few note in your readme.md file about the different way to import packages. You are not required to install any of the packages she demostrated, but I would say again surprised that Dr. Angela does not discuss virtual enivornments here.  

# Video 168
Comment out the code from video 167 and then watch the video and understand the challenge, then write your code for this challenge, once done commit your code with this message "Challenge 2 My Code". Then watch the solution and update any code you feel is better written then what your code output was. 

# Video 169
Comment out the code from video 168 and then watch the video and understand the challenge, then write your code for this challenge, once done commit your code with this message "Challenge 3 My Code". Then watch the solution and update any code you feel is better written then what your code output was. 

# Video 170
Comment out the code from video 169 and then watch the video and understand the challenge, then write your code for this challenge, once done commit your code with this message "Day 18 Challenge 4 my code". Then watch the solution and update any code you feel is better written then what your code output was. 

# Video 170
Take a few notes in your readme.md about tuples and attempt the random RGB color challenge. I found that I needed to move the code for the screen class above the code that handles the color, because t.colormode(255) did not work.  So I did screen.colormode(255) after I setup the screen object.  Once you have complete the challenge commit message "Day 18 Video 170". Then watch the solution and update any code you feel is better written then what your code output was. 

# Video 171
In your readme.md, take a few notes on the concepts of tuples and immutable from the concepets covered by Dr. Angela. 

Then, comment out code from 170 and watch the video once you have working code or want to move on the solution commit your code with "Video 171 Code", then watch the solution and update any code you feel is better written. I took a much easier approach to this one!  Dr Angela code was definately more scalable then mine.  

# Video 172
Comment out the code from video 171 and then watch the video and understand the challenge, then write your code for this challenge, once done commit your code with this message "Challenge 5 My Code". Then watch the solution and update any code you feel is better written then what your code output was. 

# Video 173
Create a new file named final.py, and then watch to understand the challenge, then write your code for this challenge, once done commit your code with message "Final P1 My Code". Here is my instructions on to setup the venv (virtual enivornment)

https://github.com/CIT95/riow-pub/blob/main/how-to/venv.md

This is the perfect time to make sure you know how to setup a venv for the colorgram package, as you know I don't install packages on my system without doing this step.  

# Video 174
In the final.py attempt the challenge and once you get the working code commit with message "Final P2 My Code". It would also be fun to post your output into discord!!!   

# Video 175
I so agree with this comparsion!!!  What do you think? Post your thought into the readme.md
