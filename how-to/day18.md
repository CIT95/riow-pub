Did you noticed the folder name here is venv....so is Dr. Angela using a virtual enivornment...I would say yes.  Such an important discussion about reading docs and searching.  

Create a new file named main_challenges.py and code along with Dr Angela, no commit needed here.

# Video 165
Watch the video and understand the challenge, then write your code for this challenge, once done commit your code with this message "Day 18 Challenge 1 my code". Then watch the solution and update any code you feel is better written then what your code output was. Did you refactor to use the shorter name?

# Video 166
Watch and take a few note in your readme.md file about the different way to import packages. You are not required to install any of the packages she demostrated, but I would say again surprised that Dr. Angela does not discuss virtual enivornment here.  

# Video 167
Comment out the code from video 165 and then watch the video and understand the challenge, then write your code for this challenge, once done commit your code with this message "Day 18 Challenge 2 my code". Then watch the solution and update any code you feel is better written then what your code output was. 

# Video 168
Comment out the code from video 167 and then watch the video and understand the challenge, then write your code for this challenge, once done commit your code with this message "Day 18 Challenge 3 my code". Then watch the solution and update any code you feel is better written then what your code output was. 

# Video 169
Comment out the code from video 168 and then watch the video and understand the challenge, then write your code for this challenge, once done commit your code with this message "Day 18 Challenge 4 my code". Then watch the solution and update any code you feel is better written then what your code output was.

Take a few notes in your readme.md about tuples and attempt the random RGB color challenge. I found that I needed to move the code for the screen class above the code that handles the color, because t.colormode(255) did not work.  So I did screen.colormode(255) after I setup the screen object.  Once you have complete the challenge commit message "Day 18 Video 170". Then watch the solution and update any code you feel is better written then what your code output was. 

# Video 171
Comment out code from 170 and watch the video and understand the challenge, once you have working code or want to move on the solution commit your code with "Day 18 Challenge 5 code", then watch the solution and update any code you feel is better written. I took a much easier approach to this one!  Dr Angela code was definately more scalable then mine.

Create a new file named main.py.  

This is the perfect time to make sure you know how to setup a venv for the colorgram package, as you know I don't install packages on my system without doing this step.  Once you have it ready to go and you get your list of colors, then commit your code this message "Day 18 Final P1 my code", then watch the video and update any code you feel needs it.

# Video 173
In the main.py attempt the challenge and once you get the working code commit with message "Day 18 Final P2 my code". It would also be fun to post your output into discord!!!   

# Video 174
I so agree with this comparsion!!!  What do you think? Post your thought into the readme.md
