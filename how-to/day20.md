# Day 20

In your 100days folder create a new folder named day20 and in that folder create a new file named readme.md.

# Video 183
In your readme.md for today, list the 7 tasks we will do to make the snake game.

# Video 184
Create a main.py in this folder and code up the first challenge of creating a 3 segment snake, once done commit your code with message "Video 184 My Code", then watch the solution and update your code as needed.
  
# Video 185
Code along with Dr. Angela and after you finish, update your understanding of the for loop in your readme.md for this day. I find that running the debugging tool and watching what happens in this code really helps me see what is going on. 

# Video 186
Watch the video to understand the challenge of creating the snake class, once you are done commit your code with this message "Video 186 My Code", then watch the solution and update your code as needed. I mostly got this working, but again I felt her code was much better than mine. 

# Video 187
Watch the video to understand the challenge of creating the snake methods for movement, once you are done commit your code with this message "Video 187 My Code", then watch the solution and update your code as needed. 

There is another challenge in this video, so give that a try and see if you can figure out the code to get that working as instructed. 

# Video 188
In your readme.md, write a comment about Programming is not memorising!
