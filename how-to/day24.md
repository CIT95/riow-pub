# Day 24
In your 100days folder create a new folder named day24 and in that folder create a new file named readme.md.

# Video 218
Watch this video to get an understand of what we will do today

# Video 219
Copy the snake game from day 21 or download the starting files from the Udemy course, then watch and code along with Dr Angela, at the end commit with message "Video 218"

# Video 220
Create the new folder in your day24 folder and name it files, then create the my_file.txt and main.py and code along with this video, because of the way Dr Angela is reading and writing to file, your code will error.  You can fix this by opening up the files folder in VSCODE.  Once you have working code then commit message "Video 219"

Note to Rio: cover this in attendance video for Week 9

# Video 221
I normally open my VSCODE with the CIT95FA21 folder open, but for this challenge open the day24 folder in VSCODE.  Then watch the video to do the setup work and attempt the challenge on your own.  Once you have working or are ready to move on commit your code with message "Video 220 my code".  Then watch the rest of the video and update your code as needed.

# Video 222
In your readme.md take a few notes on the concepts covered in this video AND attempt the challenges in this video for abs vs relative referring of files, once you have completed the challenges use commit message "Video 221 Code".  

Dr Angela, does not discuss this, but in my dev_1 this is why I use the os.path.abspath(__file__) because I want my code and therefore your code to run on either Mac or PC.  Here is a reference in the Python documentation - https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html

# Quiz 13
Take the quiz and report your score in readme.md

# Video 223
Here is how I would suggest you setup this challenge folder, inside your day 24 create a new folder named mailmerge and inside that folder copy the Mail Merge Project Start content downloading it and unzipping it from the course link.  Then open the mailmerge folder in VSCODE. 

Once you have working work or want to move on, then commit message "Video 222 My Code"

# Video 224
Watch the solution video and update any code you feel needs it. 

# Video 225
In your readme.md, what are you thoughts on this??

I love the concept of "can someone read your code", let that be your guide!!!
