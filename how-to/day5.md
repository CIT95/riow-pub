# Day 5
In your 100days folder create a new folder named day5 and in that folder create a new file named readme.md.

# Video 49
Watch the video, no output required

# Video 50
Create a new python file in your day5 folder and name it main.py and copy the starting code (or write it) into this file and then code along with Dr. Angela.  

Also makes some notes in this readme.md about loops, after you get working code, complete the git workflow with commit message "Video 50 code"

# Video 51
Create a ex1.py in this folder and then copy the starting code from the replit.com site (make sure to fix the PEP8 issues) and watch the video to the understand the coding challenge. Stop the video before the solution and write your attempt the coding challenge, once you having working code or you want to see the solution commit your code with message "My Code ex1", then watch the solution and code along, make sure you comments the solution code so both of us can clearly see your code vs the solution code. 

Question: can you do this in 1 for loop? What would you name each item in the list?

# Video 52
Create a ex2.py in this folder and then copy the starting code from the replit.com site (make sure to fix the PEP8 issues) and watch the video to the understand the coding challenge. Stop the video before the solution and write your attempt the coding challenge, once you having working code or you want to see the solution commit your code with message "My Code ex2", then watch the solution and code along, make sure you comments the solution code so both of us can clearly see your code vs the solution code.



# Video 53
Code along in the main.py file and after you get working code complete then commit with message "Video 53 code". Include a comment so you and I can see the code associated with this video.

# Video 54
Create a ex3.py in this folder and then copy the starting code from the replit.com site and watch the video to the understand the coding challenge. Stop the video before the solution and write your attempt the coding challenge, once you having working code or you want to see the solution commit your code with message "My Code ex3", then watch the solution and code along, make sure you comments the solution code so both of us can clearly see your code vs the solution code.

# Video 55
Create a ex4.py in this folder and then copy the starting code from the replit.com site and watch the video to the understand the coding challenge. Stop the video before the solution and write your attempt the coding challenge, once you having working code or you want to see the solution commit your code with message "My Code ex4", then watch the solution and code along, make sure you comments the solution code so both of us can clearly see your code vs the solution code.

# Video 56 
Create a final.py in this folder and then copy the starting code from the replit.com site and watch the video to the understand the coding challenge. Stop the video before the solution and write your attempt the coding challenge, once you having working code or you want to see the solution commit your code with message "Day 5 Final Project", then watch the solution and update your code as needed.

In your readme.md, tell me how you did on the password generator??? Did you do easy, hard or both? Did you run into any issues?  

# DONE!!
