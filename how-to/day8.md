# Day 8
In your 100days folder create a new folder named day8 and in that folder create a new file named readme.md. Make sure you are writing PEP8 compliant code.

# Video 81
Create a new python file in your day6 folder and name it functions.py and code along with Dr. Angela.  There is really a reguler challeges her so commit your code with this message "Video 81 Code".  Make sure you give the parameters and arguments a think here.

# Video 82
Code along with Dr Angela in your main.py, like before I don't feel these are regular challenges, but I hope you did stop and try the code yourself on them, commit message "Video 82 Code".  Understanding theses concept will really service you well as we go thru this course.

Create a new file named ex1.py, copy the starting code or write it, then watch to the point of understanding the challenge and then stop attempt the code, once you are done or ready to move on commit your code with message "Video 83 My Code", then watch and document the solution.

# Video 84
Create a new file named ex2.py, copy the starting code or write it, then watch to the point of understanding the challenge and then stop attempt the code, once you are done or ready to move on commit your code with message "Video 84 My Code", then watch and document the solution.

# Video 85 
Copy starting code in a new file you create and name it main.py, not need to fix the PEP8 issues we will do that at the end. Then watch to the point of understanding the challenge and then stop attempt the code, once you are done or ready to move on commit your code with "My Code Part 1". That solution to the 'zero' was easy, I really gave that one some thought and she solution seems like a hack, but it works!!

# Video 86
Remove the code from Video 85 and copy the starting copy and then watch to the point of understanding the challenge and then stop attempt the code, once you are done or ready to move on commit your code with "My Code Part 2".

# Video 87
Remove the code from Video 86 and copy the starting copy and then watch to the point of understanding the challenge and then stop attempt the code, once you are done or ready to move on commit your code with "My Code Part 3". Did you find the bug?

# Video 88
Remove the code from Video 85 and copy the starting copy and then watch to the point of understanding the challenge and then stop attempt the code, once you are done or ready to move on commit your code with "My Code Part 4". Interesting solution! Also make sure you fix the PEP8 issues on this one!
